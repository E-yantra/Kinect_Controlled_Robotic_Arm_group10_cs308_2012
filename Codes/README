Project Description
-------------------
The project aims at developing an simple and intuitive Natural User Interface (NUI) for
controlling a robotic arm, using a human arm. All the user needs to do is stand in front of a
sensor and move his arm, and the robotic arm tries to imitate the actions and movements of
the human arm. As a result, 
uid movements which cannot be performed using a controller, are
now possible to execute.

The Microsoft Kinect sensor is used to capture skeletal data of the user which is processed and
converted into a set of angles which is then sent to the robotic arm over a serial port correction.
The algorithm used to generate the angles tries to reach the same position in space as that of
the human hand with respect to the human body, relative to the base of the robotic arm. This
makes the control fairly intuitive even for First time users.
